## Screenshots

Screenshots will be added when user-facing features are tested in a browser environment.
For Task Group 1, the foundation components don't require visual testing as they will be verified when implementing page content in subsequent task groups.

## Testing Notes

Task Group 1 focused on foundational architecture:
- Layout structure
- Navigation components
- Reusable UI components
- Routing infrastructure
- Styling configuration

Visual verification will occur naturally as page content is implemented in Task Groups 2-10, at which point screenshots will be captured to verify the UI matches requirements.

## Next Steps

With the foundation complete, Task Groups 2-10 can proceed to implement:
- Homepage content (already done)
- About pages content
- Services pages content
- Projects pages content
- Training pages content
- Equipment pages content
- Blog pages content
- Resources page content
- Contact page content
- Testing & optimization

Each subsequent task group will include browser testing and screenshots as appropriate.
