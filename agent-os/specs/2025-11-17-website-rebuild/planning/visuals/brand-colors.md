## Notes for Laravel Rebuild

The client documents mention using **green #1e7e34** as the primary color for the new site, which differs from the current blue theme.

**Decision needed**: Should we:
1. Keep the current blue/teal color scheme?
2. Switch to green #1e7e34 as planned?
3. Use a combination (green primary with blue accents)?
