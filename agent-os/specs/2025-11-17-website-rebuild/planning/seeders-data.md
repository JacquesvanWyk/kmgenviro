### UserSeeder.php

```php
<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

class UserSeeder extends Seeder
{

## Seeder Execution Order

Run seeders in this sequence:

```bash
# 1. Service categories first (no dependencies)
php artisan db:seed --class=ServiceCategorySeeder

# 2. Accreditations (no dependencies)
php artisan db:seed --class=AccreditationSeeder

# 3. Admin users (no dependencies)
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```

**Or run all at once:**

Update `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run(): void
    {
        $this->call([
            ServiceCategorySeeder::class,
            AccreditationSeeder::class,
            UserSeeder::class,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

---

## Verification Steps

After running seeders:

1. **Check Database:**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker

   # Verify service categories
   >>> ServiceCategory::count()
   => 10

   # Verify accreditations
   >>> Accreditation::count()
   => 8

   # Verify users
   >>> User::count()
   => 2

   # Check sample data
   >>> ServiceCategory::first()->name
   => "Environmental Monitoring Services"
   ```

2. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Visit `/admin`
   - Log in with either admin account
   - Verify dashboard loads
   - Check navigation groups appear (empty until Phase 2 resources created)

3. **Save Passwords:**
   - Copy passwords from console output
   - Store securely (password manager recommended)
   - Share client password via secure channel

---

## Future Seeder Considerations

**Phase 2+ Seeders (Not in Phase 1):**

- **SectorSeeder:** Mining, Infrastructure, Municipal, Renewable Energy, Commercial
- **TeamMemberSeeder:** KMG staff profiles with real data
- **TrainingCourseSeeder:** Actual training courses offered
- **EquipmentCategorySeeder:** Equipment groupings
- **EquipmentSeeder:** Rental equipment inventory

**Content Population Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Foundation data only (categories, accreditations, admin users)
- Phase 2: Add sample/placeholder content for testing Filament resources
- Phase 5: Full content migration from WordPress with real data

---

## Notes

- All descriptions are real company content, not placeholder text
- Service categories match actual KMG service offerings
- Accreditations are genuine credentials held by KMG
- Logos and certificate numbers to be added in Phase 2 when resources are created
- Passwords generated randomly for security
- No hardcoded passwords in code or git
